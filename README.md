## Give your Application Auto-Deploy Superpowers
About the project : 

UdaPeople product, is a revolutionary concept in Human Resources which promises to help small businesses care better for their most valuable resource: their people.  



In this project , i was assigned to :

     * To Achieve, Build, and Deploy Automation for Cloud-Based Software Products

     *Utilize Deployment Strategies to design and build CI/CD pipelines that support Continuous Delivery processes.

     *Utilize a configuration management tool to accomplish deployment to cloud-based servers.

     *Surface critical server errors for diagnosis using centralized structured logging.



At the very end of the pipeline, i had to make a switch from the old infrastructure to the new as i learned about with the Blue Green Deployment strategy. I used CloudFormation and CloudFront to accomplish this.
